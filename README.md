**sofragment ai: where ai gets its groove back :\>**
---

welcome to **sofragment ai**, the home of lightweight, modular ai
systems built for people who donâ€™t have time for bloated,
resource-hogging nonsense. weâ€™re not here to reinvent the wheelâ€”weâ€™re
here to slap some turbojets on it and see how far we can send it flying.

our goal? to make ai your new sidekickâ€”the robin to your batman, the
luigi to your mario (or the wario, depending on your vibe). with tools
that are practical, punchy, and just a little unhinged, weâ€™re here to
show you what ai can really do.

**soren: your computerâ€™s new overlord (jkâ€¦ kinda)**

meet **soren**, our foundational **small action model (sam)** that
doesnâ€™t just sit around chattingâ€”it gets stuff done. itâ€™s like having a
super-efficient intern who doesnâ€™t take coffee breaks or accidentally
send emails to the wrong person.


**what soren brings to the table:**

â€¢ **doer of things**: automates tasks, manages files, and does all
the boring stuff you donâ€™t want to do.

â€¢ **lightweight af**: wonâ€™t slow your system down, unlike some ai
models we wonâ€™t name (ðŸ‘€).

â€¢ **smarter than it looks**: adapts to your workflow like it was born
to be there.

**solta: build agents. unleash chaos.**

coming soon, **solta** is the swiss army knife of ai frameworks. want to
build agents for your app or personal ai assistant? with solta, itâ€™s as
easy as pieâ€”assuming youâ€™ve ever made pie, which, letâ€™s be real, can be
kind of tricky. but solta? soltaâ€™s easy.


**what makes solta shine:**

â€¢ **agents galore**: create specialized agents that actually know
what theyâ€™re doing.

â€¢ **ridiculously modular**: fits into any project like it was meant
to be there.

â€¢ **developer-friendly**: because struggling with tools is so last
decade.


**why sofragment? because why not? :P**
---

hereâ€™s the thing: most ai out there is either bloated, overly
complicated, or justâ€¦ meh. weâ€™re here to fix that by building tools
that:

â€¢ **fit into your workflow like a glove.** a really smart glove.

â€¢ **actually help, instead of making you question your life
choices.**

â€¢ **are more compact than your average ikea manual but infinitely
more useful.**

plus, weâ€™ve got a healthy dose of sarcasm and zero tolerance for
nonsense. if that sounds like your vibe, youâ€™re in the right place.


**join the madness :o**

weâ€™re just getting started, which means nowâ€™s the perfect time to jump
on the bandwagon. whether youâ€™re a developer, creator, or just someone
who likes seeing what ai can do, weâ€™d love for you to join us.

â€¢ **[github](https://github.com/sofragment)**: come for the code, stay
for the occasional chaos. 

â€¢**[community chat](https://discord.gg/YMYAfstTb6)**: join the chaos, bring snacks.

thanks for stopping by **sofragment ai**, where the ai is sharp, the
sarcasm is sharper, and the possibilities are endless. letâ€™s make
something epic togetherâ€¦ or weirdâ€¦ weâ€™re good with weird. :\>
